# ABOUT
Any code/programs posted on this GitHub is for demonstration purposes only. Classes I have taken where professors specificially ask not to publicly publish repositories will not be published. Any repositories that I have been given express permission to publish are made public. These published programs are original, and can be traced back to my GitHub should anyone try to copy my code for their own problem sets. If a professor from any of the colleges/universities I have attended change their mind and request that I remove any published code, I will do so immediately. For obvious purposes, I will not answer to anyone who contacts me for answers to their own problem sets, but I am open to helping one understand CS concepts. Copying non-trivial code without understanding them is terrible practice both in university and in the long run.

These universities/colleges include:
  - Houston Community College       (attended 2018 - 2019)
  - University of Houston, Downtown (attended Spring 2020)
  - Columbia University             (attended Summer 2020 - present)

If you wish to contact me, email me:
  - rda2126@columbia.edu
  - rcda.civ@gmail.com (preferred)

Most of my repositories are made private, only to be viewed by appropriate institutional parties such as employers and/or universities.  

### Aside from class projects, my wacky personal projects will be made available here as well.
